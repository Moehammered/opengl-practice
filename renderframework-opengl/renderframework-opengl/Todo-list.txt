Transform component made
	Can rotate, but needs tests to see what is bugged/misoriented
	position is fine
	needs functions to automatically return its mat4 representations
				OR
	create a helper header that will have functions to automatically get the required mat4
	(probably better... maybe)

Camera component made
	can create a view and projection matrix
	moves around with a transform
	can be updated


Debugging Features
	Add line rendering class

;;;;;;;;;;;;Orientation debugging;;;;;;;
	Seems like orientation vectors are fine, but the actual rendering is inverted??
	see - https://community.khronos.org/t/get-direction-from-transformation-matrix-or-quat/65502/2
		seems to work when extracting the directions from rot matrix but the forward vector is flipped........

Next
	Make an fps demo to test transforms
		-started basic movement
		-needs rotation ------------------
			-rotation is inverted, mainly orientation vectors are
				
	begin entity component design
	create primitive shape types
		-cube (done but UVs are screwed for top and bottom face)
			should make individual points for the cube since each face has it's own UVs
		-sphere
